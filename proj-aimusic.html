                        ....................<br><br>-->
                        This project was pursued by a research team started in MSOE's AI club. The research team currently consists of me and four other people.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Process</b><br><br>
                        This was a more structured project. It started with a team-brainstorming session where we decided that we want to pursue an AI music generation project.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        With a project selected, we spent every week meeting for an hour to discuss what work the group members have done over the week, and to delegate tasks to work on before next meeting.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        There were no formal task-tracking tools we used, and team members were expected to occasionally have less progress than expected; we did this to account for busy schedules.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Task</b><br><br>
                        The task was to apply artificial intelligence to the problem of music generation. We narrowed this down to the task of continuing an input song by using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">midi</a> data (a type of music data).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Results/Deliverable</b><br><br>
                        The result was an artificial intelligence model which can continue any arbitrary input music data. This project is still actively being worked on, so this model is currently being further improved.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        We also had the opportunity to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2203/2203.12105.pdf">publish a paper</a> during the MICS conference held at MSOE in 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Time/Schedule</b><br><br>
                        The project started in winter of 2021-2022. The initial timeline was to meet every week until the end of that school year.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        We have since decided to continue the project into this year, and we are continuing to meet every week when classes are active.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Constraints/Challenges</b><br><br>
                        A personal challenge I faced was my limited Knowledge of the field of AI. This was also the case for most of the other team members.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Over the course of this project, me and the group members have vastly increased our experience and knowledge in AI.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Another constraint was the sparsity of meetings. This project could have been developed faster if we met multiple times a week, but we decided against this since the project didn't have a hard “ending” date.

                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Things Done Well</b><br><br>
                        The thing I did best was gaining knowledge on researching and using AI. My experiences in this project gave me the means to start my own individual AI projects.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        I also did well on my section of the paper we published. Of the paper's topics, I wrote about RNNs and LSTMs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2203/2203.12105.pdf">in the “Methods and Project Pipeline” section.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Skills Gained/Improved</b><br><br>
                        <!-- - I increased my knowledge of programming in the C language.<br><br> -->
                        - Using AI in general. (I had little prior experience with AI, and this project gave me the tools I needed to learn more.)<br><br>
                        - Programming in the Python language. (I had limited prior experience in python.)<br><br>
                        - Academic writing (for the MICS paper)<br><br>
                        - Working in a team<br><br>

                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Improvement Opportunities</b><br><br>
                        The resulting music-generation AI model did not have adequate results when we completed the first version. The results now are better, but still not at the level of a human songwriter.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        We also employed the use of a slightly outdated AI technology (LSTMS) in the first version. This has since been corrected; we are now using transformers (a different type of AI model).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Team Dynamics</b><br><br>
                        Being a team project, I was given many responsibilities and tasks over the course of the project's lifetime.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Some things I've done to contribute are:<br><br>
                        -	Research the MIDI song-storing format and find a way to interact with it.<br><br>
                        -	Research LSTMs to gain a deeper understanding of how they work in our model, and to write about them in our MICS paper.<br><br>
                        -	Explore alternate methods of music generation and audio manipulation.
