                        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainf**k is the name of an actual programming language.</a> It is meant to be a silly language, and it's so simple that it's difficult to do anything useful in it. However, its simplicity lends it to being a good learning tool.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        This was a personal individual project that I worked on over the course of a few weeks during my freshman year.

                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Process</b><br><br>
                        The process of implementing this project was casual. There was little planning, and I did what I felt like in each stage of development.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Like the <a href="./proj-raytrace.html">ray tracer project</a>, I would say this process is adequate for a casual project like this.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Task</b><br><br>
                        The task was to write a compiler that turns brainf**k code into assembly code.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Results/Deliverable</b><br><br>
                        The final product was a command-line program that takes a brainf**k file and produces an assembly file for further compilation.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        I also added a feature to the language that didn't previously exist, that feature being “procedures” to group pieces of code.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Time/Schedule</b><br><br>
                        Being a casual project, there were no hard deadlines or schedules. I worked on this project on-and-off over a few weeks in my freshman year.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Constraints/Challenges</b><br><br>
                        Like the ray tracer project, using the C language for this project was a self-imposed constraint to improve my knowledge of C.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Producing assembly (rather than interpreting) the brainf**k code was another challenge. Producing assembly is more difficult than writing an interpreter.

                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Things Done Well</b><br><br>
                        I made a working brainf**k compiler, and it supports a feature that wasn't in the original language. <br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Turning the input code into executable assembly is probably what I did best, I even included some minor optimization of the input code.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Something else I did well was making the tool work like other regular command-line compilers. You just have to supply the filename, and it generates the resulting assembly code in a new file to be further compiled. The alternative would be something like forcing the user to type their code In the terminal rather than supplying it in a file.

                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Skills Gained/Improved</b><br><br>
                        <!-- - I increased my knowledge of programming in the C language.<br><br> -->
                        - I vastly improved my assembly knowledge. Particularly, the compiler emits assembly of the “nasm” format.<br><br>
                        - I also improved my understanding of the C programming language.<br><br>
                        - Most of all, I gained important knowledge about how to write compilers in general. While this project only compiled a simple language, the skills I've gained from it can be applied to more useful languages.

                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Improvement Opportunities</b><br><br>
                        This project went very well, so there was little room for improvement in the final result. One minor annoyance is the syntax for calling procedures.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        Currently, you prepend a dollar sign to the procedure-name for it to be called. While it's only a minor detail, I believe that the extra dollar sign is ultimately unnecessary; it was just a quick fix for the problem of figuring out whether a procedure is being defined or called.

                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">The way procedures work</b><br><br>
                        Pieces of brainf**k code can be put between two curly braces and a leading name to define a procedure. E.G.,<br><br>
                        <code>
                            addl{<br>
                                <[>>+<<-]><br>
                                >[<+<+>>-]<<br>
                            }
                        </code><br><br>
                        Once a procedure is defined, you can call it later by writing its name with a dollar sign in front (E.G, <code>$addl</code>). Procedures can be called from anywhere; even inside other procedures.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides procedures, I also added a custom instruction. The slash character '/' prints a specified number.<br><br>
                        In the original brainf**k language, you are only able to print the ascii character of numbers, and not the numbers themselves.
                    </p>
