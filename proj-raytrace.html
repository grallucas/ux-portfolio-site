                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <!--
                    <p>This project was a personal one I started near the beginning of my freshman year at MSOE. I originally pursued it because I had a lot of time to kill early on in my first year; I had more time between classes back then.</p>
                    <p>I chose to implement a ray tracer because I was (and still am) interested in computer graphics. I had already read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://raytracing.github.io/">“ray tracing in a weekend”</a> book, so I wanted to see if I could implement a ray tracer from scratch with no guidance.</p>
                    <p>Being a casual project, my approach wasn't planned in detail before I started. Instead, I just jumped right into the development process, doing anything I had to do in the moment.</p>
                    <p>In the end, the final product was a program that you could run to open a window with a ray-traced scene. You can control the camera's position and the position of the red sphere. </p>
                    <p>All in all, it took about a week of on-and-off work to complete this project. It never really reached a “finished” state other than being a working ray tracer.</p>
                    -->
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Context</b><br><br>
                        A "ray tracer" is a program that draws a 3-dimensional scene by simulating rays of light.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        This was an individual personal project that I started around the beginning of my freshman year.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Process</b><br><br>
                        The process of this project was casual. I jumped into it with little planning and did what I thought was best in each moment. I would deem this approach as adequate because this was just a casual personal project.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Task</b><br><br>
                        The task was to implement a functional ray tracer in C. Preferably with the ability to move around the scene and to render in real-time.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Results/Deliverable</b><br><br>
                        The final deliverable was a program that you could run to open a window with a ray-traced scene. A user can control the camera's position and the position of the red sphere.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Time/Schedule</b><br><br>
                        There were no hard deadlines I set for myself. The project took about a week of on-and-off work.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Constraints/Challenges</b><br><br>
                        The main constraint was using the C language (a language well-known for being difficult and minimalist). This self-given constraint was imposed so that I could improve my knowledge of the C language. <br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        I also tried not to rely on many external resources. I had previously written ray tracers while following a guide, but this time I did everything from scratch.

                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <!--
                    <p>The ray tracer itself is functional and runs in real-time. I'm especially proud of this since the ray tracer isn't using a GPU (more details in “Technical details”).</p>
                    <p>Other than the ray tracer itself, I also structured my code well. C programs are infamously more difficult to maintain than those in higher-level languages. I wrote many utility functions to handle vector mathematics and drawing, and I would happily reuse these utilities.</p>
                    <p>I picked-up and started several skills that I have since found useful. Other than the obvious one (knowing how to write a ray tracer), I also improved my knowledge linear algebra (a field of math used for computer graphics), and my skills in writing C (a low-level programming language).</p>
                    <p>Similarly to my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"href="">brainf**k project</a>, I used C for this project because I was drawn-in by the charm of writing sufficiently complex programs in such a bare-bones language. Not only is writing in C a fun challenge, but being closer to assembly language, it improves your understanding of how a computer actually works.</p>
                    <p>Despite the personal successes of this project, there is a visual glitch you might have noticed where the ground is either red or blue. This was unintentional. I believe that better planning and more careful debugging would have solved this.</p>

                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Things Done Well</b><br><br>
                        I got a fully functional interactive ray tracer that runs in real-time. I would say the fact that it runs in real-time is what I did best, because ray tracers are known to be computationally heavy.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        I also did well considering that I wrote this project in C. I was drawn-in by the charm of writing sufficiently complex programs in such a bare-bones language, similar to my <a href="./proj-bfcomp.html">brainf**k project</a>.

                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Skills Gained/Improved</b><br><br>
                        - I increased my knowledge of programming in the C language.<br><br>
                        - Writing this complex C program improved my understanding of how a computer works at a level closer to hardware.<br><br>
                        - Got a deeper understanding of how ray tracers work. This is especially the case, because I didn't rely too much on external resources.<br><br>
                        - I also improved my knowledge of linear algebra (a field of math used for computer graphics)<br><br>

                    <p> 
                        <b style="color: var(--hl1)">Improvement Opportunities</b><br><br>
                        In the end, I reached my goal of creating a functioning real-time ray tracer with interactivity. However, there are opportunities for improvement that I've applied to future projects.<br>
                        ....................<br><br>
                        There is a visual glitch where the ground is either red or blue. This was unintentional. I believe that slightly better planning and more careful debugging would have solved this.

                    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                    <p>I specifically avoided using the GPU for this ray tracer, something that would be completely unreasonable for any serious project. The reason behind this was to satisfy a curiosity: how performant could I make a ray tracer that only runs on the CPU? The answer: quite performant (at a low resolution).</p>
                    <p>I used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> to create and draw on the window, and I implemented everything else from scratch in C.</p>
